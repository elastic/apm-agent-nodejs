# Test Next.js versions.
#
# - We instrument `>=11.1.0 <13.3.0`.
# - We don't test next@11 because spurious errors.
# - We don't test every patch-level release, because that's too much.
# - For the latest version, we guard on the *minor* version, because 13.2 and
#   13.3 releases have both broken our instrumentation.
