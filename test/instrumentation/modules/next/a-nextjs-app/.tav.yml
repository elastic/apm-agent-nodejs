# Test Next.js versions.
#
# - We instrument Next.js ">=11.1.0 <14.0.0". I don't see much value in testing
#   every patch-level release. Instead we will test the latest patch release
#   for each minor. (It would be nice if tav supported this natively.)
# - Next.js 11 supports back to node v12.22.0 and v14.5.0. However, when this
#   instrumentation was added, Node v12 was already EOL, so there is less value
#   in testing it.
