== Supported technologies

The Elastic APM Node.js Agent automatically instruments various APIs in Node.js core and third-party frameworks and packages. This page lists all supported technologies and version ranges.


[float]
[[compatibility-node]]
=== Node.js versions

Support for the Elastic APM Node.js agent follows the https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/[support schedule of Node.js itself]
to the end-of-life period of each version after its maintenance term.
Versions of Node.js past their end-of-life date are not supported.

image::./images/node_release_schedule.svg[Node.js release schedule]

The current APM agent version (3.x) works with Node.js versions back to v8.6. We will only break support for older Node.js versions with a major version release of the APM agent.

[float]
[[compatibility-esm]]
=== ECMAScript Modules (ESM)

Beginning with version v3.48.0, the Elastic APM Node.js agent includes
_limited and experimental_ support for instrumenting
https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html#modules-ecmascript-modules[ECMAScript module imports],
i.e. modules that are loaded via `import ...` statements and `import('...')` (dynamic import).
See the <<esm>> document for details.

Note: If you are using TypeScript or JavaScript that is _compiled/translated/transpiled to CommonJS-using JavaScript_ via tools like Babel, Webpack, esbuild, etc., then using `import ...` in your source code is fine. To ensure your compiler is generating JS that uses CommonJS imports, use the following settings:

- For TypeScript, use https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#module[`"module": "commonjs"` in your "tsconfig.json"] (a https://github.com/tsconfig/bases/blob/main/bases/node16.json[complete tsconfig.json example]).
- For Babel, use https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-env#modules[`"modules": "commonjs"` in your Babel config] (https://github.com/elastic/apm-agent-nodejs/blob/main/test/babel/.babelrc[for example]).
- For Webpack, use `target: 'node', externalsPresets: { node: true }` in your "webpack.config.js".
- For esbuild, use `--platform=node --target=node...` options to `esbuild` (https://github.com/elastic/apm-agent-nodejs/blob/main/examples/esbuild/package.json#L7[for example]).

[[elastic-stack-compatibility]]
=== Elastic Stack Compatibility

// See the APM agent compatibility table: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/apm/guide/current/agent-server-compatibility.html

This agent is compatible with {apm-guide-ref}[APM Server] v6.6 and above.


[float]
[[compatibility-frameworks]]
=== Frameworks

Though you can use Elastic APM <<custom-stack,with any Node.js framework>>,
we automate a few things for the most popular Node.js modules.
These are the frameworks that we officially support:

[options="header"]
|=======================================================================
| Framework             | Version | Note
| <<lambda,AWS Lambda>> | N/A |
| <<azure-functions,Azure Functions>> | ~4 | See https://learn.microsoft.com/en-ca/azure/azure-functions/set-runtime-version[the guide on Azure Functions runtime versions].
| <<express,Express>>   | ^4.0.0 |
| <<fastify,Fastify>>   | >=1.0.0 | See also https://www.fastify.io/docs/latest/Reference/LTS/[Fastify's own LTS documentation]
| <<hapi,@hapi/hapi>>   | >=17.9.0 <22.0.0 |
| <<hapi,hapi>>         | >=9.0.0 <19.0.0 | Deprecated. No longer tested.
| <<koa,Koa>> via koa-router or @koa/router | >=5.2.0 <13.0.0 | Koa doesn't have a built in router, so we can't support Koa directly since we rely on router information for full support. We currently support the most popular Koa router called https://github.com/koajs/koa-router[koa-router].
| <<nextjs,Next.js>>    | >=11.1.0 <13.3.0 | (Technical Preview) This instruments Next.js routing to name transactions for incoming HTTP transactions; and reports errors in user pages. It supports the Next.js production server (`next start`) and development server (`next dev`). See the <<nextjs,Getting Started document>>.
| <<restify,Restify>>   | >=5.2.0 <12.0.0 |
|=======================================================================

[float]
[[compatibility-opentelemetry]]
=== OpenTelemetry

The Node.js Elastic APM agent supports usage of the OpenTelemetry Tracing API
via its <<opentelemetry-bridge>>. As well, it instruments the OpenTelemetry
Metrics API and Metrics SDK to allow
<<otel-metrics-api,usage of the OpenTelemetry Metrics API>>.

[options="header"]
|=======================================================================
| Framework | Version
| <<opentelemetry-bridge,@opentelemetry/api>> | >=1.0.0 <1.5.0
| https://www.npmjs.com/package/@opentelemetry/sdk-metrics[@opentelemetry/sdk-metrics] | >=1.11.0 <2
|=======================================================================


[float]
[[compatibility-custom-transactions]]
=== Custom Transactions

By default transactions are named based on their matched HTTP route if the framework used is listed above.
These modules override that behavior to give better insights into specialized HTTP servers:

[options="header"]
|=======================================================================
|Module |Version |Note
|https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-graphql[express-graphql] |>=0.6.1 <0.13.0 |Will name all transactions by the GraphQL query name. There is a https://github.com/elastic/apm-agent-nodejs/issues/2516[known issue with node <10.4]. This module is deprecated and is no longer tested.
|https://www.npmjs.com/package/apollo-server-express[apollo-server-express] |>=2.0.4 <4|Will name all transactions by the GraphQL query name. Versions before 2.9.6 are no longer tested.
|https://www.npmjs.com/package/@apollo/server[@apollo/server] |>=4.0.0|Will name all transactions by the GraphQL query name
|=======================================================================

[float]
[[compatibility-tracing-and-instrumentation]]
=== Tracing and Instrumentation

The Node.js agent will automatically instrument the following modules to give you detailed performance metrics:

[options="header"]
|=======================================================================
|Module |Version |Note

|https://www.npmjs.com/package/ws[ws] |>=1.0.0 <8.0.0 |Will instrument outgoing WebSocket messages
|=======================================================================

[float]
[[compatibility-better-stack-traces]]
=== Better Stack Traces

The APM agent <<span-stack-trace-min-duration,can be configured>> to capture
span stack traces, to show where in your code a span (e.g. for a database query)
was initiated.

Given the async nature of Node.js, it's not possible for the APM agent to see
further back than the last async boundary. Modules that happen to have an async
boundary between a call from your application code and the action that leads
to an APM span will limit the utility of these span stack traces.

The modules listed below are those that the APM agent instruments to provide
more useful span stack traces -- ones that point to your application code --
when enabled.

If you don't see your own code in spans,
please create a new topic in the https://discuss.elastic.co/c/apm[Elastic APM discuss forum] and include information about your dependencies.

[options="header"]
|=================================================
|Module |Version |Note
|https://www.npmjs.com/package/knex[knex] |>=0.10.0 <3.0.0 | Provides better span stack traces for 'pg' and 'mysql' spans. Instrumentation of Knex >=0.95.0 is not supported when using the deprecated <<context-manager,`contextManager=patch`>> configuration option.
|=================================================

[float]
[[compatibility-continuity]]
=== Continuity

The Elastic APM agent monitors async operations in your Node.js application to maintain awareness of which request is the active request at any given time.
Certain modules can interfere with this monitoring if not handled properly.

Below is a list of modules known to cause issues with this monitoring.
The versions listed are the versions we support.
If you use an unsupported version you might experience missing spans.
This does not impact the stability of your application in any way - only the collected metrics.

If you do experience missing spans in your performance metrics,
please create a new topic in the https://discuss.elastic.co/c/apm[Elastic APM discuss forum] and include information about your dependencies and what data is missing.

[options="header"]
|=======================================================================
|Module |Version |Note
|https://www.npmjs.com/package/bluebird[bluebird] |>=2.0.0 <4.0.0 |
|https://www.npmjs.com/package/generic-pool[generic-pool] | ^2.0.0 \|\| ^3.1.0 |Used
by a lot of database modules like for instance "pg"
|https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-queue[express-queue] |>=0.0.11 <1.0.0 |
