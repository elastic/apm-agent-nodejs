== Troubleshooting

Is something not working as expected?
Don't worry if you can't figure out what the problem is; weâ€™re here to help!
As a first step, ensure your app is compatible with the agent's <<supported-technologies,supported technologies>>.

If you're an existing Elastic customer with a support contract, please create a ticket in the
https://support.elastic.co/customers/s/login/[Elastic Support portal].
Other users can post in the https://discuss.elastic.co/c/apm[APM discuss forum].

IMPORTANT: *Please upload your complete debug logs* to a service like https://gist.github.com[GitHub Gist]
so that we can analyze the problem.
Logs should include everything from when the application starts up until the first request executes.
See <<debug-mode>> for more information.

[[no-data-sent]]
=== No data is sent to the APM Server

If neither errors nor performance metrics are being sent to the APM Server,
it's a good idea to first check your log file and look for output just as the app starts.

[float]
[[error-messages]]
==== Explanation of error messages

[float]
[[message-agent-inactive]]
===== Agent Inactive

[source,text]
----
Elastic APM agent is inactive due to configuration
----

You've most likely set the `active` option or the `ELASTIC_APM_ACTIVE` environment variable to `false`.
Ensure that it's set to `true` and try again.

See the API documentation about <<active,`active`>> for details.

[float]
[[message-missing-service-name]]
===== Missing `serviceName`

[source,text]
----
Elastic APM isn't correctly configured: Missing serviceName
----

Ensure that the agent is correctly configured with a `serviceName` config option either by passing it to the `start()` function,
by specifying it in the optional configuration file,
or by using environment variables.

See the API documentation on <<service-name,`serviceName`>> for details.

[float]
[[message-invalid-service-name]]
===== Invalid `serviceName`

[source,text]
----
Elastic APM isn't correctly configured: serviceName "..." contains invalid characters! (allowed: a-z, A-Z, 0-9, _, -, <space>)
----

The `serviceName` you provided contained invalid characters.
You can only use the letters a-z (both upper and lowercase), numbers, underscore (`_`), hyphen (`-`), and space (` `).

See the API documentation on <<service-name,`serviceName`>> for details.

[float]
[[missing-performance-metrics]]
=== No performance metrics sent to APM Server

Errors get tracked just fine,
but you don't see any performance metrics.

First, make sure you have https://www.npmjs.com/package/elastic-apm-node[the latest version] of the Elastic APM Node.js agent.
Issues are fixed and support for new metrics are added all the time,
so make sure you keep your dependency up to date.

If you are using the latest version but still don't see any performance metrics,
make sure that the agent is *both required and started at the very top of your main app file* (usually the `index.js`, `server.js` or `app.js` file).
It's important that the agent is started before any other modules are required.
If not,
the agent will not be able to hook into any modules and will not be able to measure the performance of your application.

IMPORTANT: If you are using Babel / ES modules in your application,
make sure you have read about the <<es-modules,Babel / ES Module support>>.

If this is not the issue,
your app dependencies might be incompatible with the agent.
Please create a new topic in the https://discuss.elastic.co/c/apm[Elastic APM discuss forum] and try to include as much information as possible, such as:

* The dependencies in you `package.json` file
* Your app's main js file showing how the agent is initialized (usually the `index.js`, `server.js` or `app.js` file)
* Your server logs with Elastic APM debugging enabled

[float]
[[debug-mode]]
=== Debug mode

To enable agent debugging and capture enough information for troubleshooting,
perform these steps:

1. Start your app with the environment variable `ELASTIC_APM_LOG_LEVEL=trace` or add `logLevel: 'trace'` to the config file or `start(options)` call (see <<log-level,`logLevel`>> for details)
2. Send a few HTTP requests to some of the app endpoints
3. Wait at least 10 seconds to allow the agent to try and connect to the APM Server (controlled by <<api-request-time,`apiRequestTime`>>)

[float]
[[disable-agent]]
=== Disable the Agent

In the unlikely event the agent causes disruptions to a production application,
you can disable the agent while you troubleshoot.

To disable the agent, set <<active,`active`>> to `false`.
You'll need to restart your application for the changes to apply.
