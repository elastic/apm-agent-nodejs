=== Monitoring Node.js Azure Functions

The Node.js APM Agent can trace function invocations in an https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/[Azure Functions] app.


[float]
[[azure-functions-prerequisites]]
==== Prerequisites

You need an APM Server to send APM data to. Follow the
{apm-guide-ref}/apm-quick-start.html[APM Quick start] if you have not set one up
yet. You will need your *APM server URL* and an APM server *secret token* (or
*API key*) for configuring the APM agent below.

You will also need an Azure Function app to monitor. If you do not have an
existing one, you can follow https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/create-first-function-cli-node#create-supporting-azure-resources-for-your-function[this Azure guide]
to create one.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you use `func init --javascript ...` as suggested in this Azure guide,
then it is recommended that you *uninstall* the `azure-functions-core-tools`
dependency by running `npm uninstall azure-functions-core-tools` and
https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-core-tools#installing[install it separately].
Having `azure-functions-core-tools` as a "devDependency" in your package.json
will result in unreasonably large deployments that will be very slow to publish
and will run your Azure Function app VM out of disk space.)
====

You can also take a look at and use this https://github.com/elastic/apm-agent-nodejs/tree/main/examples/an-azure-function-app/[Azure Functions example app with Elastic APM already integrated].

[[azure-functions-setup]]
==== Step 1: Add the APM agent dependency

Add the `elastic-apm-node` module as a dependency of your application:

[source,bash]
----
npm install elastic-apm-node --save  # or 'yarn add elastic-apm-node'
----


[float]
==== Step 2: Start the APM agent

For the APM agent to instrument Azure Functions, it needs to be started when the
Azure host starts its Node.js worker processes. The best way to do so is by
using an app-level entry point (support for this was added for Node.js Azure
Functions https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-nodejs-worker/issues/537[here]).

1. Create a module to start the APM agent. For example, a file at the root of your repository named "initapm.js":
+
[source,javascript]
----
// initapm.js
require('elastic-apm-node').start({
  <1>
})
----
<1> Optional <<configuration,configuration options>> can be added here.

2. Add a "main" entry to your package.json pointing to the app init file.
+
[source,json]
----
...
  "main": "initapm.js",
...
----
+
If your application already has a "main" init file, you can instead add the
`require('elastic-apm-node').start()` to top of that file.


[float]
==== Step 3: Configure the APM agent

The APM agent can be <<configuring-the-agent,configured>> with options to the
`.start()` method or with environment variables. Using environment variables
allows one to use https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-how-to-use-azure-function-app-settings?tabs=portal#settings[application settings in the Azure Portal] which allows hiding values and updating settings
without needing to re-deploy code.

Open _Configuration > Application settings_ for your Function App in the Azure Portal
and set:

[source,yaml]
----
ELASTIC_APM_SERVER_URL: <your APM server URL from step 1>
ELASTIC_APM_SECRET_TOKEN: <your APM secret token from step 1>
----

For example:

image::./images/azure-functions-configuration.png[Configuring the APM Agent in the Azure Portal]

For local testing via `func start` you can set these environment variables in
your terminal, or in the "local.settings.json" file. See the
<<configuration,agent configuration guide>> for full details on supported
configuration variables.


[float]
==== Step 4: (Re-)deploy your Azure Function app

[source,bash]
----
func azure functionapp publish <APP_NAME>
----

Now, when you invoke your Azure Functions, you should see your application
show up as a Service in the APM app in Kibana and see APM transactions for
function invocations.  Tracing data is forwarded to APM server after a period
of time, so allow a minute or so for data to appear.


[float]
[[azure-functions-limitations]]
==== Limitations

This instrumentation does not send an APM transaction or error to APM server when
a handler has an `uncaughtException` or `unhandledRejection`.
The Azure Functions Node.js reference https://learn.microsoft.com/en-ca/azure/azure-functions/functions-reference-node#use-async-and-await[has a section] with best practices for avoiding these cases.

Azure Functions instrumentation currently does _not_ collect system metrics in
the background because of a concern with unintentionally increasing Azure
Functions costs (for Consumption plans).
