=== Upgrade to v4.x

The following is a guide on upgrading your APM Node.js agent
(`elastic-apm-node`) from version 3.x to version 4.x.

[[v4-nodejs]]
==== Node.js versions

Version 4.0.0 of the Node.js APM agent supports Node.js v14.5.0 and later.


[[v4-config-options]]
==== Config options

===== `ELASTIC_APM_KUBERNETES_*`

Support for the following Kubernetes environment variables have been removed:
`ELASTIC_APM_KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE`, `ELASTIC_APM_KUBERNETES_NODE_NAME`,
`ELASTIC_APM_KUBERNETES_POD_NAME`, and `ELASTIC_APM_KUBERNETES_POD_UID`. The
correct environment variables for these config vars are _without_ the
`ELASTIC_APM_` prefix -- for example
<<kubernetes-pod-name,`KUBERNETES_POD_NAME`>> -- and has been documented that
way since v2.11.0.

===== `filterHttpHeaders`

Support for `filterHttpHeaders` config option has been removed. Redaction of
HTTP headers and also request cookies is controlled by the existing config
option <<sanitize-field-names, `sanitizeFieldNames`>>.

===== `useElasticTraceparentHeader`

The default value of the <<use-elastic-traceparent-header>> config option has
changed to `false`. This means that the vendor-specific
`elastic-apm-traceparent` header will no longer be added to outgoing HTTP
requests. The `traceparent` header (from the
https://w3c.github.io/trace-context/[W3C trace-context standard]) is added by
the APM agent. If you want the agent to continue sending
`elastic-apm-traceparent` HTTP header you can set it to `true` via env var or
start options.


[[v4-api-changes]]
==== API changes

[[v4-api-to-string]]
===== `span.toString()`, `transaction.toString()`

The `span.toString()` and `transaction.toString()` methods have been removed as
documented APIs. They were never in the "index.d.ts" types and were deprecated
in v3.23.0.

Since v2.17.0 they would return a string of the form `trace.id=<hex id the
trace> span.id=<hex id of the span>`, with the intent that this could be used in
text-only loggers for log correlation. Using `.toString()` for this was
deprecated in v3.23.0, and has now been removed in v4. In v4 the output of
`.toString()` is not defined.

Instead, prefer the use of <<span-ids,`span.ids`>>,
<<transaction-ids,`transaction.ids`>>, or
<<apm-current-trace-ids,`apm.currentTraceIds`>>. The v3 format may be reproduced
via:

[source,js]
----
const {stringify} = require('querystring');
console.log( stringify(span.ids, ' ', '=')) );
----

For log correlation with _structured_ logs, see <<log-correlation-ids>>.

[[v4-api-start-transaction]]
===== `agent.startTransaction()`

The `agent.startTransaction()` method has been changed to return a do-nothing
no-op Transaction, if the agent is not yet started. The return type has changed to
no longer include `| null`. The intent of these changes is to allow the user to use
`.startTransaction()` without having to worry if the agent is yet started, nor to
have to handle a possible `null` return value.
