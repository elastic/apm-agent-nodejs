=== `Transaction` API

A transaction groups multiple spans in a logical group.

To get a `Transaction` object,
you need to call <<apm-start-transaction,`apm.startTransaction()`>>.

To see an example of using custom transactions,
see the <<custom-transactions,Custom Transactions in Node.js>> article.

[[transaction-name]]
==== `transaction.name`

* *Type:* String
* *Default:* `unnamed`

The name of the transaction.

Can be used to set or overwrite the name of the transaction (visible in the performance monitoring breakdown).
If you don't have access to the current transaction,
you can also set the name using <<apm-set-transaction-name,`apm.setTransactionName()`>>.

Transactions with the same name and <<transaction-type,type>> are grouped together.

[[transaction-type]]
==== `transaction.type`

* *Type:* String
* *Default:* `custom`

The type of the transaction.

There's a special type called `request` which is used by the agent for the transactions automatically created when an incoming HTTP request is detected.

[[transaction-result]]
==== `transaction.result`

* *Type:* Number
* *Default:* `200`

The transaction result.

Think of the transaction result as equivalent to the status code of an HTTP response.

[[transaction-start-span]]
==== `transaction.startSpan([name][, type])`

[source,js]
----
var span = transaction.startSpan('My custom span')
----

Start and return a new custom span associated with this transaction.

Arguments:

* `name` - The name of the span (string).
You can alternatively set this via <<span-name,`span.name`>>.
Defaults to `unnamed`

* `type` - The type of span (string).
You can alternatively set this via <<span-type,`span.type`>>.
Defaults to `custom`

When a span is started it will measure the time until <<span-end,`span.end()`>> is called.

See <<span-api,Span API>> docs for details on how to use custom spans.

[[transaction-ensure-parent-id]]
==== `transaction.ensureParentId()`

* *Type:* String

If the transaction does not already have a parent id,
calling this method generates a new parent id,
sets it as the parent id of this transaction,
and returns it as a `String`.

This enables the correlation of the spans the JavaScript Real User Monitoring (RUM) agent creates for the initial page load with the transaction of the backend service.
If your backend service generates the HTML page dynamically,
initializing the JavaScript RUM agent with the value of this method allows analyzing the time spent in the browser vs in the backend services.

To enable the JavaScript RUM agent,
add a snippet similar to this to the body of your HTML page,
preferably before other JavaScript libraries:

[source,js]
----
var apm = initApm({
  pageLoadTraceId: "${transaction.traceId}",
  pageLoadSpanId: "${transaction.ensureParentId()}",
  pageLoadSampled: ${transaction.sampled}
})
----

See the {apm-rum-ref}[JavaScript RUM agent documentation] for more information.

[[transaction-end]]
==== `transaction.end([result])`

[source,js]
----
transaction.end([result])
----

Ends the transaction.
If the transaction has already ended,
nothing happens.

Alternatively you can call <<apm-end-transaction,`apm.endTransaction()`>> to end the active transaction.

A value may be provided to set as a result.
