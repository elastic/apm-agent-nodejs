=== `Transaction` API

A transaction groups multiple spans in a logical group.

To get a `Transaction` object,
you need to call <<apm-start-transaction,`apm.startTransaction()`>>.

To see an example of using custom transactions,
see the <<custom-transactions,Custom Transactions in Node.js>> article.

[[transaction-name]]
==== `transaction.name`

* *Type:* String
* *Default:* `unnamed`

The name of the transaction.

Can be used to set or overwrite the name of the transaction (visible in the performance monitoring breakdown).
If you don't have access to the current transaction,
you can also set the name using <<apm-set-transaction-name,`apm.setTransactionName()`>>.

Transactions with the same name and <<transaction-type,type>> are grouped together.

[[transaction-type]]
==== `transaction.type`

* *Type:* String
* *Default:* `custom`

The type of the transaction.

There's a special type called `request` which is used by the agent for the transactions automatically created when an incoming HTTP request is detected.

[[transaction-result]]
==== `transaction.result`

* *Type:* Number
* *Default:* `200`

The transaction result.

Think of the transaction result as equivalent to the status code of an HTTP response.

[[transaction-end]]
==== `transaction.end()`

[source,js]
----
transaction.end()
----

Ends the transaction and <<span-truncate,truncates>> all un-ended child spans.
If the transaction has already ended,
nothing happens.

Alternatively you can call <<apm-end-transaction,`apm.endTransaction()`>> to end the active transaction.
