=== Upgrade to v1.x

The following is a guide on upgrading your Node.js agent from version 0.x to version 1.x.

[[v1-overview]]
==== Overview

Version 1.x of the Node.js agent requires version 6.2 of the APM Server or higher.

The term "trace" was previously used to describe a small piece of work instrumented by the agent during a transaction.
To align with modern APM vendors,
we now refer to this as a "span"

The term "app" was previously used to describe your Node.js application in relation to Elastic APM.
To be more specific,
we now refer to this as a "service".
