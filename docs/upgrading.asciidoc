== Upgrading

The Elastic APM Node.js Agent uses https://semver.org/[semantic versioning], and
therefore upgrades between minor versions of the agent, for example from 1.1 to
1.2, are always backwards compatible. Upgrades that involve a major version bump
often come with some backwards incompatible changes.

Before upgrading the agent, be sure to review the:

* <<release-notes,Node.js APM Agent release notes>>
* {apm-guide-ref}/agent-server-compatibility.html[APM Agent and Server compatibility chart]

The following upgrade guides are available:

* <<upgrade-to-v4,Upgrade to v4.x>> from version 3.x of the Elastic APM Node.js agent.
* <<upgrade-to-v3,Upgrade to v3.x>> from version 2.x of the Elastic APM Node.js agent.
* <<upgrade-to-v2,Upgrade to v2.x>> from version 1.x of the Elastic APM Node.js agent.
* <<upgrade-to-v1,Upgrade to v1.x>> from version 0.x of the Elastic APM Node.js agent.

=== End of life dates

We love all our products, but sometimes we must say goodbye to a release so that we can continue moving
forward on future development and innovation.
Our https://www.elastic.co/support/eol[End of life policy] defines how long a given release is considered supported,
as well as how long a release is considered still in active development or maintenance.
