== Log correlation

In order to correlate logs from your app with transactions captured by the
Elastic APM Node.js Agent, your logs must contain one or more of the following identifiers:

* `transaction.id`
* `trace.id`
* `span.id`

The Node.js Agent provides the `apm.currentTraceIds` method to help with this task.

:leveloffset: -1
include::agent-api.asciidoc[tag=currentTraceIds]
:leveloffset: +1

Using your favorite logging framework, you'd then need to inject this information into your logs.

When your logs contain the appropriate identifiers, the final step is to ingest them into the same
Elasticsearch instance that contains your APM data. See
{apm-overview-ref-v}/observability-integrations.html#_ingest_your_logs_into_elasticsearch[Ingest your logs into Elasticsearch]
for more information.
