== Introduction

Welcome to the APM Node.js Agent documentation.

NOTE: The documentation pages are still work in progress.
For more details also check the APM Node.js Agent https://github.com/elastic/apm-agent-nodejs[GitHub repository].

The Elastic APM Node.js agent sends performance metrics and errors to the APM Server.
It has built-in support for the most popular frameworks and routers,
as well as a simple API which allows you to instrument any application.
The agent is only one of multiple components you need to get started with APM.
