=== Get started with Next.js

The Elastic APM Node.js agent can be used to trace the Next.js server (`next
start` or `next dev`) that runs your application without the need for code
changes to your app. The APM transactions for incoming HTTP requests to the
server will be named for the https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/introduction[pages]
and https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction[API endpoints] in your
application, as well as for internal routes used by Next.js. Errors in code run
on the server will be reported for viewing in the Kibana APM app.

Note that the Node.js APM agent can only instrument _server-side_ code. To
monitor the client-side parts of a Next.js application, see the
{apm-rum-ref}/intro.html[Elastic RUM agent].

NOTE: This Next.js instrumentation is a _technical preview_ while we solicit feedback
from Next.js users. That means that how the instrumentation works might change
in future versions of the agent.  If you are a Next.js user, please help us provide a better Next.js observability experience with your feedback on our https://discuss.elastic.co/tags/c/apm/nodejs[Discuss forum].

[[nextjs-prerequisites]]
==== Prerequisites

You need an APM Server to send APM data to. Follow the
{apm-guide-ref}/apm-quick-start.html[APM Quick start] if you have not set one up
yet. You will need your *APM server URL* and an APM server *secret token* (or
*API key*) for configuring the APM agent below.

You will also need a Next.js application to monitor. If you do not have an
existing one to use, you can use the following to create a starter app (see
https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started[Next.js Getting Started docs] for more):

[source,bash]
----
npx create-next-app@latest  # use the defaults
cd my-app
----

You can also take a look at and use this https://github.com/elastic/apm-agent-nodejs/tree/main/examples/nextjs/[Next.js + Elastic APM example app].

NOTE: XXX Until this is merged, the example is at: <https://github.com/elastic/apm-agent-nodejs/tree/trentm/feat-nextjs/examples/nextjs/>

[[nextjs-setup]]
==== Step 1: Add the APM agent dependency

Add the `elastic-apm-node` module as a dependency to your application:

[source,bash]
----
npm install elastic-apm-node --save  # or 'yarn add elastic-apm-node'
----

NOTE: XXX Until this is in a release use `npm install "elastic-apm-node@elastic/apm-agent-nodejs#trentm/feat-nextjs"`.


[float]
==== Step 2: Start the APM agent

For the APM agent to instrument the Next.js server, it needs to be started
before the Next.js server code is loaded. The best way to do so is by using
Node's https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#-r---require-module[`--require`] option
to load the "elastic-apm-node/start-next.js" module -- this will start the agent
(plus a little more for Next.js integration).

Edit the "dev" and "start" scripts in your "package.json" as follows:

[source,json]
----
{
  // ...
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "NODE_OPTIONS=--require=elastic-apm-node/start-next.js next dev",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "NODE_OPTIONS=--require=elastic-apm-node/start-next.js next start",
    "lint": "next lint"
  },
  // ...
}
----


[float]
==== Step 3: Configure the APM agent

The APM agent can be
<<configuring-the-agent,configured>>
with environment variables or with an "elastic-apm-node.js" module in the
current working directory. Note that because the APM agent is being loaded
before the Next.js server, the
https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/environment-variables[Next.js-supported
".env" files] *cannot* be used to configure the APM agent. We will use an
"elastic-apm-node.js" file here.

Create an "elastic-apm-node.js" file in the application root with the APM server
URL and secret token values from the <<nextjs-prerequisites>> section above:

[source,javascript]
----
// elastic-apm-node.js
module.exports = {
  serverUrl: 'https://...',  // E.g. https://my-deployment-name.apm.us-west2.gcp.elastic-cloud.com
  secretToken: '...'
}
----

The equivalent using environment variables is:

[source,bash]
----
export ELASTIC_APM_SERVER_URL='https://...'
export ELASTIC_APM_SECRET_TOKEN='...'
----

See the <<configuration,agent configuration guide>> for full details on supported configuration variables.


[float]
==== Step 4: Start your Next.js app

[source,bash]
----
npm run dev  # or 'npm run build && npm start' for the production server
----

Open <http://localhost:3000> in your browser to load your Next.js app. If you
used the `create-next-app` tool above, it defines an
http://localhost:3000/api/hello[/api/hello] API endpoint. You can provide some
artificial load by running the following in a separate terminal:

[source,bash]
----
while true; do sleep 1; curl -i http://localhost:3000/api/hello; done
----

Visit your Kibana APM app and, after a few seconds, you should see a service
entry for your Next.js app. (The service name will be pulled from the "name"
field in "package.json". It can be overriden with
<<service-name,`serviceName`>>. Here is an example:

[[nextjs-limitations]]
==== Limitations and future work

This Next.js instrumentation has some limitations to be aware of.

Next.js build tooling bundles dependencies (using Webpack) for both client _and_
server-side code execution. The Node.js APM agent does not work when bundled.
See <<start-bundlers>> for details. The implication for Next.js instrumentation
is that you cannot directly import and use the APM agent in your code. That
means that using the <<agent-api>> for manual instrumentation is not currently
possible.

This instrumentation supports naming APM transactions for many internal Next.js
routes.  For example, for
https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/get-server-side-props[server-side
rendering (SSR)] Next.js client code will make requests of the form `GET
/next/_data/$buildId/$page.json`, for which the APM agent names the transaction
`Next.js _next/data route $page`. However, there is a limitation with the
Next.js "public folder catchall" route. HTTP requests that resolve to files in
your "public/" directory, for example `GET /favicon.ico`, will result in a
transaction named `GET unknown route`. See <<nextjs-unknown-routes>> below.

If you notice other limitations or have any suggestions, please give us feedback
on our https://discuss.elastic.co/tags/c/apm/nodejs[Discuss forum].

[[nextjs-performance-monitoring]]
==== Performance monitoring

Elastic APM automatically measures the performance of your Next.js application.
It records spans for database queries, external HTTP requests, and other slow
operations that happen during requests to your Next.js app. Spans are grouped in
transactions -- by default one for each incoming HTTP request.
