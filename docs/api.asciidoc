== API Reference

The API reference documentation is divided into three parts:

* <<agent-api,The `Agent` API>> - All functions and properties on the `Agent` object.
An instance of the `Agent` object is acquired by requiring/importing the Node.js APM Agent module.
The `Agent` is a singleton and the instance is usually referred by the variable `apm` in this documentation

* <<transaction-api,The `Transaction` API>> - All functions and properties on the `Transaction` object.
An instance of the `Transaction` object is acquired by calling `apm.startTransaction()`

* <<span-api,The `Span` API>> - All functions and properties on the `Span` object.
An instance of the `Span` object is acquired by calling `apm.buildSpan()`
