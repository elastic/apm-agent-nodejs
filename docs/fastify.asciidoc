=== Get started with Fastify

Getting Elastic APM set up for your Fastify app is easy,
and there are various ways you can tweak it to fit your needs.

Follow the guide below to get started, and for more advanced topics,
check out the <<api,API Reference>>.

[[fastify-installation]]
==== Installation

Add the `elastic-apm-node` module as a dependency to your application:

[source,bash]
----
npm install elastic-apm-node --save
----

[float]
[[fastify-initialization]]
==== Initialization

It's important that the agent is started before you require *any* other modules in your Node.js application - i.e. before `fastify`, `http`, etc.

This means that you should probably require and start the agent in your application's main file (usually `index.js`, `server.js` or `app.js`).

Here's a simple Fastify example with the Elastic APM agent installed:

[source,js]
----
// Add this to the VERY top of the first file loaded in your app
var apm = require('elastic-apm-node').start({
  // Override service name from package.json
  // Allowed characters: a-z, A-Z, 0-9, -, _, and space
  serviceName: '',

  // Use if APM Server requires a token
  secretToken: '',

  // Set custom APM Server URL (default: http://localhost:8200)
  serverUrl: '',
})

// Require the framework and instantiate it
var fastify = require('fastify')({
  logger: true
})

// Declare a route
fastify.get('/', function (request, reply) {
  reply.send({ hello: 'world' })
})

// Run the server!
fastify.listen(3000, function (err, address) {
  if (err) throw err
  fastify.log.info('server listening on', address)
})
----

The agent will now monitor the performance of your Fastify application and record any uncaught exceptions.
