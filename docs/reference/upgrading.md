# Upgrading [upgrading]

The Elastic APM Node.js Agent uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/), and therefore upgrades between minor versions of the agent, for example from 1.1 to 1.2, are always backwards compatible. Upgrades that involve a major version bump often come with some backwards incompatible changes.

Before upgrading the agent, be sure to review the:

* [Node.js APM Agent release notes](/release-notes/index.md)
* [APM Agent and Server compatibility chart](docs-content://solutions/observability/apm/apm-agent-compatibility.md)

The following upgrade guides are available:

* [Upgrade to v4.x](/reference/upgrade-to-v4.md) from version 3.x of the Elastic APM Node.js agent.
* [Upgrade to v3.x](/reference/upgrade-to-v3.md) from version 2.x of the Elastic APM Node.js agent.
* [Upgrade to v2.x](/reference/upgrade-to-v2.md) from version 1.x of the Elastic APM Node.js agent.
* [Upgrade to v1.x](/reference/upgrade-to-v1.md) from version 0.x of the Elastic APM Node.js agent.


## End of life dates [end-of-life-dates]

We love all our products, but sometimes we must say goodbye to a release so that we can continue moving forward on future development and innovation. Our [End of life policy](https://www.elastic.co/support/eol) defines how long a given release is considered supported, as well as how long a release is considered still in active development or maintenance.
