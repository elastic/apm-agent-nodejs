# Set up the Agent [set-up]

To get you off the ground, weâ€™ve prepared guides for setting up the Agent with a few different popular web frameworks and technologies:

* [Monitoring AWS Lambda Node.js Functions](/reference/lambda.md)
* [Monitoring Node.js Azure Functions](/reference/azure-functions.md)
* [Get started with Express](/reference/express.md)
* [Get started with Fastify](/reference/fastify.md)
* [Get started with hapi](/reference/hapi.md)
* [Get started with Koa](/reference/koa.md)
* [Get started with Restify](/reference/restify.md)
* [Get started with TypeScript](/reference/typescript.md)

Alternatively, you can [Get started with a custom Node.js stack](/reference/custom-stack.md). For Kubernetes, we support auto-attachment using the [APM attacher](apm-k8s-attacher://reference/index.md).

To see an overview of which components of your application we instrument automatically, use the [*Supported technologies*](/reference/supported-technologies.md) page.

Other useful documentation includes:

* [Starting the agent](/reference/starting-agent.md)
* [*Configuration*](/reference/advanced-setup.md)
* [*API Reference*](/reference/api.md)
* [*Troubleshooting*](docs-content://troubleshoot/observability/apm-agent-nodejs/apm-nodejs-agent.md)
