=== `Span` API

A span measures the duration of a single event.

To get a `Span` object,
you need to call <<apm-build-span,`apm.buildSpan()`>>.

To see an example of using custom spans,
see the <<custom-spans,Custom Spans in Node.js>> article.

[[span-transaction]]
==== `span.transaction`

* *Type:* Transaction

A reference to the parent transaction object.

All spans belongs to a transaction.

[[span-name]]
==== `span.name`

* *Type:* String
* *Default:* `unnamed`

The name of the span.
This can also be set via <<span-start,`span.start()`>>.

[[span-type]]
==== `span.type`

* *Type:* String
* *Default:* `custom`

The type of span.
This can also be set via <<span-start,`span.start()`>>.

The type is a hierarchical string used to group similar spans together.
For instance,
all spans of MySQL queries are given the type `db.mysql.query`.

In the above example `db` is considered the type prefix.
Though there are no naming restrictions for this prefix,
the following are standardized across all Elastic APM agents:
`app`, `db`, `cache`, `template`, and `ext`.

[[span-start]]
==== `span.start()`

[source,js]
----
span.start([name][, type])
----

Start a span.

Arguments:

* `name` - The name of the span (string).
You can alternatively set this via <<span-name,`span.name`>>.
Defaults to `unnamed`

* `type` - The type of span (string).
You can alternatively set this via <<span-type,`span.type`>>.
Defaults to `custom.code`

When a span is started it will measure the time until <<span-end,`span.end()`>> or <<span-truncate,`span.truncate()`>> is called.

[[span-end]]
==== `span.end()`

[source,js]
----
span.end()
----

End the span.
If the span has already ended,
nothing happens.

A span that isn't ended before the parent transaction ends will be <<span-truncate,truncated>>.

[[span-truncate]]
==== `span.truncate()`

[source,js]
----
span.truncate()
----

Truncates and ends the span.
If the span is already ended or truncated,
nothing happens.

A truncated span is a special type of ended span.
It's used to indicate that the measured event took longer than the duration recorded by the span.
