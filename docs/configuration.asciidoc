=== Configuration options

The available configuration options and equivalent environment variable names are listed below.

For more information on setting configuration options, including configuration precedence,
see <<configuring-the-agent, configuring the agent>>.

TIP: The only required parameter is <<service-name,`serviceName`>>.
However,
the agent will use the `name` from `package.json` by default if available.

[[service-name]]
==== `serviceName`

* *Type:* String
* *Default:* `name` field of `package.json`
* *Env:* `ELASTIC_APM_SERVICE_NAME`

Your Elastic APM service name.

Allowed characters: `a-z`, `A-Z`, `0-9`, `-`, `_`, and space.

[float]
[[service-node-name]]
==== `serviceNodeName`

* *Type:* String
* *Env:* `ELASTIC_APM_SERVICE_NODE_NAME`

A unique name for the service node.
This is optional, and if omitted,
the APM Server will fall back on `system.container.id` if available,
and finally `host.name` if necessary.

This option allows you to set the node name manually to ensure uniqueness and meaningfulness.

[[secret-token]]
==== `secretToken`

* *Type:* String
* *Env:* `ELASTIC_APM_SECRET_TOKEN`

The secret token optionally expected by the APM Server.

[[api-key]]
==== `apiKey`

* *Type:* String
* *Env:* `ELASTIC_APM_API_KEY`

The API key optionally expected by the APM Server. This is an alternative to `secretToken`.

This base64-encoded string is used to ensure that only your agents can send data to your APM server. You must have created the API key using the APM server command line tool. Please see the {apm-server-ref}/api-key.html[APM server documentation] for details on how to do that.

NOTE: This feature is fully supported in the APM Server versions >= 7.6.

WARNING: The API key is sent as plain-text in every request to the server, so you should secure your communications using HTTPS. Unless you do so, your API key could be observed by an attacker.

[[server-url]]
==== `serverUrl`

* *Type:* String
* *Default:* `http://localhost:8200`
* *Env:* `ELASTIC_APM_SERVER_URL`

The URL to where the APM Server is deployed.

[[validate-server-cert]]
==== `verifyServerCert`

* *Type:* Boolean
* *Default:* `true`
* *Env:* `ELASTIC_APM_VERIFY_SERVER_CERT`

By default the agent will validate the TLS/SSL certificate of the APM Server if using HTTPS.
You can switch this behavior off by setting this option to `false`.

[[server-ca-cert-file]]
==== `serverCaCertFile`

* *Type:* String
* *Env:* `ELASTIC_APM_SERVER_CA_CERT_FILE`

By default the agent will validate the TLS/SSL certificate of the APM Server using the
well-known CAs curated by Mozilla, as described in the Node.js docs for
https://nodejs.org/api/tls.html#tls_tls_createsecurecontext_options[`tls.createSecureContext()`].
You can set this option to the path of a file containing a CA certificate that will be
used instead.

Specifying this option is required when using self-signed certificates, unless server
certificate validation is disabled.

[[service-version]]
==== `serviceVersion`

* *Type:* String
* *Default:* `version` field of `package.json`
* *Env:* `ELASTIC_APM_SERVICE_VERSION`

The version of the app currently running.
This could be the version from your `package.json` file,
a git commit reference,
or any other string that might help you pinpoint a specific version or deployment.

[[active]]
==== `active`

* *Type:* Boolean
* *Default:* `true`
* *Env:* `ELASTIC_APM_ACTIVE`

A boolean specifying if the agent should be active or not.
If active,
the agent will instrument incoming HTTP requests and track errors.
Normally you would not want to run the agent in your development or testing environments.
If you are using the `NODE_ENV` environment variable,
you can use this to determine the state:

[source,js]
----
var options = {
  active: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'
}
----

[[environment]]
===== `environment`

* *Type:* String
* *Default:* `process.env.NODE_ENV || 'development'`
* *Env:* `ELASTIC_APM_ENVIRONMENT`

The environment name is automatically logged along with all errors and transactions.
If you want to overwrite this,
use this option.

Environments allow you to easily filter data on a global level in the APM app.
It's important to be consistent when naming environments across agents.
See {kibana-ref}/filters.html#environment-selector[environment selector] in the APM app for more information.

NOTE: This feature is fully supported in the APM app in Kibana versions >= 7.2.
You must use the query bar to filter for a specific environment in versions prior to 7.2.

[[disable-send]]
==== `disableSend`

* *Type:* Boolean
* *Default:* `false`
* *Env:* `ELASTIC_APM_DISABLE_SEND`

If set to `true`, the agent will work as usual, except for any task requiring
communication with the APM server. Events will be dropped and the agent won't be
able to receive central configuration, which means that any other configuration
cannot be changed in this state without restarting the service.  Example uses
for this setting are: maintaining the ability to create traces and log
trace/transaction/span IDs through the log correlation feature, and getting
automatic distributed tracing via the https://w3c.github.io/trace-context/[W3C
HTTP headers].

[[instrument]]
==== `instrument`

* *Type:* Boolean
* *Default:* `true`
* *Env:* `ELASTIC_APM_INSTRUMENT`

A boolean specifying if the agent should automatically apply instrumentation to supported modules when they are loaded.

Note that both `active` and `instrument` needs to be `true` for instrumentation to be running.

[[instrument-incoming-http-requests]]
==== `instrumentIncomingHTTPRequests`

* *Type:* Boolean
* *Default:* `true`
* *Env:* `ELASTIC_APM_INSTRUMENT_INCOMING_HTTP_REQUESTS`

A boolean specifying if the agent should instrument incoming HTTP requests.

To configure if outgoing http requests should be instrumented,
see <<disable-instrumentations, `disableInstrumentations`>>.

[[central-config]]
==== `centralConfig`

* *Type:* Boolean
* *Default:* `true`
* *Env:* `ELASTIC_APM_CENTRAL_CONFIG`

Activate APM Agent Configuration via Kibana.
If set to `true`, the client will poll the APM Server regularly for new agent configuration.

NOTE: This feature requires APM Server v7.3 or later and that the APM Server is configured with `kibana.enabled: true`.
More information is available in {kibana-ref}/agent-configuration.html[APM Agent configuration].

[[async-hooks]]
==== `asyncHooks`

* *Type:* Boolean
* *Default:* `true`
* *Env:* `ELASTIC_APM_ASYNC_HOOKS`

A boolean specifying if the agent should use the experimental https://nodejs.org/api/async_hooks.html[Async Hooks] API found in Node.js version 8.2.0 and above.
This setting has no effect when running a Node.js version older than 8.2.0.

If you experience any issues related to using Async Hooks,
please https://github.com/elastic/apm-agent-nodejs/issues[open an issue].

Note that not all core Node.js API's can be instrumented without the use of Async Hooks if running Node.js 8 or above.

[[transaction-ignore-urls]]
==== `transactionIgnoreUrls`

* *Type:* Array
* *Default:* `[]`
* *Env:* `ELASTIC_APM_TRANSACTION_IGNORE_URLS`
* <<dynamic-configuration, image:./images/dynamic-config.svg[] >> *Central config name:* `transaction_ignore_urls`

Array or comma-separated string used to restrict requests for certain URLs from being instrumented.

When an incoming HTTP request is detected, its URL pathname will be tested against each string
in this list.  The `transactionIgnoreUrls` property supports exact string matches,
simple wildcard (`*`) matches, and may not include commas.  Wildcard matches are
case-insensitive by default. You may make wildcard searches case-sensitive by
using the `(?-i)` prefix.

Note that all errors that are captured during a request to an ignored URL are still sent
to the APM Server regardless of this setting.

If you need full regular expression pattern matching, see <<ignore-urls>>.

Example usage:

[source,js]
----
require('elastic-apm-node').start({
  transactionIgnoreUrls: [
    '/ping',
    '/fetch/*',
    '(?-i)/caseSensitiveSearch'
  ]
})
----


[[ignore-urls]]
==== `ignoreUrls`

* *Type:* Array
* *Default:* `undefined`

Used to restrict requests to certain URLs from being instrumented.

This property should be set to an array containing one or more strings or `RegExp` objects.
When an incoming HTTP request is detected,
its URL will be tested against each element in this list.
If an element in the array is a `String`,
an exact match will be performed.
If an element in the array is a `RegExp` object,
its test function will be called with the URL being tested.

Note that all errors that are captured during a request to an ignored URL are still sent to the APM Server regardless of this setting.

If you'd prefer simple wildcard pattern matching, see <<transaction-ignore-urls>>.

Example usage:

[source,js]
----
require('elastic-apm-node').start({
  ignoreUrls: [
    '/ping',
    /^\/admin\//i
  ]
})
----

[[ignore-user-agents]]
==== `ignoreUserAgents`

* *Type:* Array
* *Default:* `undefined`

Used to restrict requests from certain User-Agents from being instrumented.

This property should be set to an array containing one or more strings or `RegExp` objects.
When an incoming HTTP request is detected,
the User-Agent from the request headers will be tested against each element in this list.
If an element in the array is a `String`,
it's matched against the beginning of the User-Agent.
If an element in the array is a `RegExp` object,
its test function will be called with the User-Agent string being tested.

Note that all errors that are captured during a request by an ignored user agent are still sent to the APM Server regardless of this setting.

Example usage:

[source,js]
----
require('elastic-apm-node').start({
  ignoreUserAgents: [
    'curl/',
    /pingdom/i
  ]
})
----

[[capture-body]]
==== `captureBody`

* *Type:* String
* *Default:* `off`
* *Env:* `ELASTIC_APM_CAPTURE_BODY`
* <<dynamic-configuration, image:./images/dynamic-config.svg[] >> *Central config name:* `capture_body`

The HTTP body of incoming HTTP requests is not recorded and sent to the APM Server by default.

Possible options are: `off`, `all`, `errors`, and `transactions`.

* `off` - request bodies will never be reported
* `errors` - request bodies will only be reported with errors
* `transactions` - request bodies will only be reported with request transactions
* `all` - request bodies will be reported with both errors and request transactions

The recorded body will be truncated if larger than 2 KiB.

If the body parsing middleware captures the body as raw `Buffer` data, the request body will be represented as the string `"<Buffer>"`.

For the agent to be able to access the body,
the body needs to be available as a property on the incoming HTTP https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_incomingmessage[`request`] object.
The agent will look for the body on the following properties:
`req.json || req.body || req.payload`

[[capture-headers]]
==== `captureHeaders`

* *Type:* Boolean
* *Default:* true
* *Env:* `ELASTIC_APM_CAPTURE_HEADERS`

The HTTP headers of incoming HTTP requests,
and its resulting response headers,
are recorded and sent to the APM Server by default.
This can be disabled by setting this option to `false`.

[[error-on-aborted-requests]]
==== `errorOnAbortedRequests`

* *Type:* Boolean
* *Default:* `false`
* *Env:* `ELASTIC_APM_ERROR_ON_ABORTED_REQUESTS`

A boolean specifying if the agent should monitor for aborted TCP connections with un-ended HTTP requests.
An error will be generated and sent to the APM Server if this happens.

[[aborted-error-threshold]]
==== `abortedErrorThreshold`

* *Type:* Number
* *Default:* `25s`
* *Env:* `ELASTIC_APM_ABORTED_ERROR_THRESHOLD`

Specify the threshold for when an aborted TCP connection with an un-ended HTTP request is considered an error.
The value is expected to be in seconds,
or should include a time suffix.

If the `errorOnAbortedRequests` property is `false`, this property is ignored.

[[transaction-sample-rate]]
==== `transactionSampleRate`

* *Type:* Number
* *Default:* `1.0`
* *Env:* `ELASTIC_APM_TRANSACTION_SAMPLE_RATE`
* <<dynamic-configuration, image:./images/dynamic-config.svg[] >> *Central config name:* `transaction_sample_rate`

Specify the sampling rate to use when deciding whether to trace a request.

This must be a value between `0.0` and `1.0`, where `1.0` means 100% of requests
are traced. The value is rounded to four decimal places of precision (e.g.
0.0001, 0.3333) to ensure consistency and reasonable size when propagating the
sampling rate in the `tracestate` header for
<<distributed-tracing,distributed tracing>>.

[[hostname]]
==== `hostname`

* *Type:* String
* *Default:* OS hostname
* *Env:* `ELASTIC_APM_HOSTNAME`

The OS hostname is automatically logged along with all errors and transactions.
If you want to overwrite this,
use this option.

[[framework-name]]
==== `frameworkName`

* *Type:* String
* *Env:* `ELASTIC_APM_FRAMEWORK_NAME`

Set the name of the web framework used by the instrumented service/application.
The name will be available as metadata for all errors and transactions sent to the APM Server.
This can be useful for debugging and filtering.

By default,
the agent will set the value of this config option if the framework can be detected automatically.

[[framework-version]]
==== `frameworkVersion`

* *Type:* String
* *Env:* `ELASTIC_APM_FRAMEWORK_VERSION`

Set the version of the web framework used by the instrumented service/application.
The version will be available as metadata for all errors and transactions sent to the APM Server.
This can be useful for debugging and filtering.

By default,
the agent will set the value of this config option if the framework can be detected automatically.

Example of setting <<framework-name,`frameworkName`>> and `frameworkVersion` for a framework named `my-custom-framework`:

[source,js]
----
// read the version from the package.json file
var frameworkVersion = require('my-custom-framework/package').version

require('elastic-apm-node').start({
  frameworkName: 'my-custom-framework',
  frameworkVersion: frameworkVersion
})
----

[[log-level]]
==== `logLevel`

* *Type:* String
* *Default:* `'info'`
* *Env:* `ELASTIC_APM_LOG_LEVEL`
* <<dynamic-configuration, image:./images/dynamic-config.svg[] >> *Central config name:* `log_level`

Set the verbosity level for the agent's logging. Note that this does not have
any influence on the types of errors that are sent to the APM Server. This only
controls how chatty the agent is in your logs. Possible levels are: `trace`
(the most verbose logging, avoid in production), `debug`, `info`, `warning`,
`error`, `critical`, and `off` (disable all logging).

This config only applies when using the built-in logger. Log levels will not
be automatically applied to a custom <<logger,`logger`>>.

[[logger]]
==== `logger`

* *Type:* object
* *Env:* `ELASTIC_APM_LOGGER=false` to _ignore_ a custom logger

By default, the APM agent logs to stdout in
{ecs-logging-ref}/intro.html[ecs-logging] format. Use the `logger` config to
pass in a custom logger object. The custom logger must provide `trace`,
`debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, and `fatal` methods that take a string
message argument.

A custom logger may result in _structured log data being lost_. As of version
3.13, the agent uses structured logging using the
https://getpino.io/#/docs/api?id=logger[pino API]. To avoid issues with
incompatible logger APIs, a given custom logger is wrapped in such a way that
only the log message is passed through. As a special case, if the provided
logger is a _pino logger instance_, then it will be used directly without
loss of structured fields. Setting the environment variable
`ELASTIC_APM_LOGGER=false` will *ignore* a custom logger. This is provided to
assist with <<debug-mode>> troubleshooting.

An example using a custom pino logger:

[source,js]
----
const pino = require('pino')
require('elastic-apm-node').start({
  logger: pino({ level: 'info' })
})
----

or using a https://github.com/trentm/node-bunyan[Bunyan] logger:

[source,js]
----
const bunyan = require('bunyan')
require('elastic-apm-node').start({
  logger: bunyan.createLogger({ level: 'info' })
})
----

To get the https://github.com/watson/console-log-level[unstructured logging output]
similar to agent versions before 3.13, use the following:

[source,js]
----
require('elastic-apm-node').start({
  logger: require('console-log-level')()
})
----

[[capture-exceptions]]
==== `captureExceptions`

* *Type:* Boolean
* *Default:* `true`
* *Env:* `ELASTIC_APM_CAPTURE_EXCEPTIONS`

Whether or not the agent should monitor for uncaught exceptions and send them to the APM Server automatically.

[[log-uncaught-exceptions]]
==== `logUncaughtExceptions`

* *Type:* Boolean
* *Default:* `false`
* *Env:* `ELASTIC_APM_LOG_UNCAUGHT_EXCEPTIONS`

By default the stack trace of a uncaught exception is not written to STDERR when the agent is active.
Set this config option to `true` to have the agent write stack traces of uncaught exceptions to STDERR.

[[capture-error-log-stack-traces]]
==== `captureErrorLogStackTraces`

* *Type:* String
* *Default:* `messages`
* *Env:* `ELASTIC_APM_CAPTURE_ERROR_LOG_STACK_TRACES`

Normally only `Error` objects have a stack trace associated with them.
This stack trace is stored along with the error message when the error is sent to the APM Server.
The stack trace points to the place where the `Error` object was instantiated.

But sometimes it's valuable to know,
not where the `Error` was instantiated,
but where it was detected.
For instance,
when an error happens deep within a database driver,
the location where the error bubbles up to,
is sometimes more useful for debugging,
than where the error occurred.

Set this config option to `always` to --
besides the error stack trace --
also capture a stack trace at the location where <<apm-capture-error,`captureError`>> was called.

By default,
this config option has the value `messages`,
which means that a stack trace of the capture location will be recorded only when `captureError` is called with either a <<message-strings,string>> or the <<parameterized-message-object,special parameterized message object>>,
in which case a normal stack trace isn't available.

Set this config option to `never` to never record a capture location stack trace.

A capture location stack trace is never generated for uncaught exceptions.

[[capture-span-stack-traces]]
==== `captureSpanStackTraces`

* *Type:* Boolean
* *Default:* `true`
* *Env:* `ELASTIC_APM_CAPTURE_SPAN_STACK_TRACES`

Set this option to `false` to disable capture of stack traces.

When set to `true` the agent will capture stack traces for spans whose duration falls within the <<span-frames-min-duration, `spanFramesMinDuration`>> threshold.

[[span-frames-min-duration]]
==== `spanFramesMinDuration`

* *Type:* String
* *Default:* `10ms`
* *Env:* `ELASTIC_APM_SPAN_FRAMES_MIN_DURATION`

A time value to control whether the agent will report stack traces for measured spans. If a span's duration reaches this threshold, the agent will report stack traces. If <<capture-span-stack-traces, `captureSpanStackTraces`>> is set to `false` the agent will ignore the `spanFramesMinDuration` value.

When set to `0` the agent will not record stack traces for any spans.

When set to a negative value (like `-1ms`) the agent will always record stack traces for spans.

[[use-path-as-transaction-name]]
==== `usePathAsTransactionName`

* *Type:* Boolean
* *Default:* `false`
* *Env:* `ELASTIC_APM_USE_PATH_AS_TRANSACTION_NAME`

Set this option to `true` to use the URL path as the transaction name if no other route could be determined. If the agent do not support your router, you can set this option to `true` to use specific URL path as the transaction name instead of `GET unknown route`.

[[source-context-error]]
==== `sourceLinesErrorAppFrames` + `sourceLinesErrorLibraryFrames`

When an error is captured by the agent,
its stack trace is stored in Elasticsearch.

By default, the agent will also collect a few lines of source code around the lines for each frame in the stack trace.
This can make it easier to determine the cause of an error as the source code related to the error is visible directly in Kibana.

The agent differentiates between so-called in-app frames and library frames.
Library frames are frames belonging to Node core and code inside the application's `node_modules` folder.
In-app frames are everything else.

Use the following two config options to change how many lines of source code to include for the different types of stack frames:

[[source-context-error-app-frames]]
*`sourceLinesErrorAppFrames`*

* *Type:* Number
* *Default:* `5`
* *Env:* `ELASTIC_APM_SOURCE_LINES_ERROR_APP_FRAMES`

The default value `5` means that 5 lines of source code will be collected for in-app error frames.
2 lines above the stack frame line + 2 below + the stack frame line itself.

Setting this config option to `0` means that no source code will be collected for in-app error frames.

[[source-context-error-library-frames]]
*`sourceLinesErrorLibraryFrames`*

* *Type:* Number
* *Default:* `5`
* *Env:* `ELASTIC_APM_SOURCE_LINES_ERROR_LIBRARY_FRAMES`

The default value `5` means that 5 lines of source code will be collected for error library frames.
2 lines above the stack frame line + 2 below + the stack frame line itself.

Setting this config option to `0` means that no source code will be collected for error library frames.

[[source-context-span]]
==== `sourceLinesSpanAppFrames` + `sourceLinesSpanLibraryFrames`

When a span is recorded by the agent,
a stack trace is recorded together with the span,
pointing to the location where the span was initiated.
This stack trace is stored in Elasticsearch along with the other span data.

By default, the agent will also collect a few lines of source code around the lines for each frame in the stack trace.
This can make it easier to determine why and how the span was initiated as the source code related to the span is visible directly in Kibana.

The agent differentiates between so-called in-app frames and library frames.
Library frames are frames belonging to Node core and code inside the applications `node_modules` folder.
In-app frames are everything else.

Use the following two config options to change how many lines of source code to include for the different types of stack frames:

[[source-context-span-app-frames]]
*`sourceLinesSpanAppFrames`*

* *Type:* Number
* *Default:* `0`
* *Env:* `ELASTIC_APM_SOURCE_LINES_SPAN_APP_FRAMES`

The default value `0` means that no source code will be collected for in-app span frames.

[[source-context-span-library-frames]]
*`sourceLinesSpanLibraryFrames`*

* *Type:* Number
* *Default:* `0`
* *Env:* `ELASTIC_APM_SOURCE_LINES_SPAN_LIBRARY_FRAMES`

The default value `0` means that no source code will be collected for span library frames.

[[error-message-max-length]]
==== `errorMessageMaxLength`

* *Type:* String
* *Default:* `2kb`
* *Env:* `ELASTIC_APM_ERROR_MESSAGE_MAX_LENGTH`

The maximum length allowed for error messages.
It is expressed in bytes or includes a size suffix such as `2kb`.
Size suffixes are case-insensitive and include `b`,
`kb`,
`mb`,
and `gb`.
Messages above this length will be truncated before being sent to the APM Server.

Set to `-1` do disable truncation.

This applies to the following properties:

- `error.exception.message`
- `error.log.message`

[[stack-trace-limit]]
==== `stackTraceLimit`

* *Type:* Number
* *Default:* `50`
* *Env:* `ELASTIC_APM_STACK_TRACE_LIMIT`

Setting it to `0` will disable stack trace collection.
Any finite integer value will be used as the maximum number of frames to collect.
Setting it to `Infinity` means that all frames will be collected.

[[transaction-max-spans]]
==== `transactionMaxSpans`

* *Type:* Number
* *Default:* `500`
* *Env:* `ELASTIC_APM_TRANSACTION_MAX_SPANS`
* <<dynamic-configuration, image:./images/dynamic-config.svg[] >> *Central config name:* `transaction_max_spans`

Specify the maximum number of spans to capture within a request transaction
before dropping further spans.
Setting to `-1` means that spans will never be dropped.

[[max-queue-size]]
==== `maxQueueSize`

* *Type:* Number
* *Default:* `1024`
* *Env:* `ELASTIC_APM_MAX_QUEUE_SIZE`

The maximum size of buffered events.

Events like transactions, spans, and errors are buffered when the agent can't
keep up with sending them to the APM Server or if the APM server is down.
If the queue is full, events are rejected which means you will lose
transactions and spans. This guards the application from consuming too much
memory and possibly crashing in case the APM server is unavailable for a longer
period of time.

A lower value will decrease the heap overhead of the agent, while a higher
value makes it less likely to lose events in case of a temporary spike in
throughput.

[[api-request-time]]
==== `apiRequestTime`

* *Type:* String
* *Default:* `10s`
* *Env:* `ELASTIC_APM_API_REQUEST_TIME`

The agent maintains an open HTTP request to the APM Server that is used to transmit the collected transactions,
spans,
and errors to the server.

To avoid issues with intermittent proxies and load balancers,
the HTTP request is ended and a new one created at regular intervals controlled by this config option.
The value is expected to be in seconds,
or should include a time suffix.

[NOTE]
====
The HTTP request is ended before the time threshold is reached if enough bytes are sent over it.
Use the <<api-request-size,`apiRequestSize`>> config option to control the byte threshold.
====

[[api-request-size]]
==== `apiRequestSize`

* *Type:* String
* *Default:* `768kb`
* *Env:* `ELASTIC_APM_API_REQUEST_SIZE`

The agent maintains an open HTTP request to the APM Server that is used to transmit the collected transactions,
spans,
and errors to the server.

To avoid issues with intermittent proxies and load balancers,
the HTTP request is ended and a new one created if its body becomes too large.
That limit is controlled by this config option.
The value is expected to be in bytes,
or include a size suffix such as `1mb`.
Size suffixes are case-insensitive and include `b`,
`kb`,
`mb`,
and `gb`.

[NOTE]
====
The HTTP request is otherwise ended at regular intervals controlled by the <<api-request-time,`apiRequestTime`>> config option.
====

[[server-timeout]]
==== `serverTimeout`

* *Type:* String
* *Default:* `30s`
* *Env:* `ELASTIC_APM_SERVER_TIMEOUT`

Specify the response timeout when reporting transactions to APM Server.
The timeout should be in seconds,
or should include a time suffix.

The timeout is applied once the agent has sent the entire request body to the APM Server.
If the response from the server takes longer than allowed by this timeout,
the HTTP request is terminated and the TCP socket closed.

[[sanitize-field-names]]
==== `sanitizeFieldNames`
* *Type:* Array
* *Default:* `['password', 'passwd', 'pwd', 'secret', '*key', '*token*', '*session*', '*credit*', '*card*', 'authorization', 'set-cookie', 'pw', 'pass', 'connect.sid']`
* *Env:* `ELASTIC_SANITIZE_FIELD_NAMES`
* <<dynamic-configuration, image:./images/dynamic-config.svg[] >> *Central config name:* `sanitize_field_names`

Remove sensitive data sent to Elastic APM.

The `sanitizeFieldNames` configuration value allows you to configure a list of wildcard patterns of field names which should be redacted from agent payloads. Wildcard matches are
case-insensitive by default. You may make wildcard searches case-sensitive by
using the `(?-i)` prefix. These patterns apply to the request and response HTTP headers, as well as any form field captured during an `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` data request.

The `sanitizeFieldNames` will redact any matched _field names_.  If you wish to filter or _redact_ other data the <<filter-http-headers,`filterHttpHeaders`>> configuration field or the <<apm-add-filter,API filtering functions>> may be a better choice.

[[filter-http-headers]]
==== `filterHttpHeaders`

* *Type:* Boolean
* *Default:* `true`
* *Env:* `ELASTIC_APM_FILTER_HTTP_HEADERS`

When tracing an incoming HTTP request,
the agent will add metadata about the requests to the recorded transaction.
The same applies for errors that occur and are captured as a result of the request.

This boolean specifies if the agent should anonymize certain sensitive HTTP headers by default before they are sent to the APM Server.
When anonymized,
the header value will be set to `[REDACTED]`

Currently, the following HTTP headers are anonymized by default:

* `Authorization` - The full value of this header is redacted.  In versions of the agent greater than v3.9, the authorization header is redacted by the default configuration of <<sanitize-field-names>>.
* `Cookie` - The cookies inside the `Cookie` header are analyzed and their values redacted if they appear sensitive (like a session cookie).
  See the https://github.com/watson/is-secret[is-secret] module for details about which patterns are considered sensitive.

If you wish to filter or sanitize other data,
use one of the <<apm-add-filter,filtering>> functions.

[[disable-instrumentations]]
==== `disableInstrumentations`

* *Type:* Array of strings
* *Env:* `ELASTIC_APM_DISABLE_INSTRUMENTATIONS`

Array or comma-separated string of modules to disable instrumentation for.
When instrumentation is disabled for a module,
no spans will be collected for that module.

Example using options object:

[source,js]
----
require('elastic-apm-node').start({
  disableInstrumentations: ['graphql', 'express-graphql']
})
----

Example using environment variable:

[source,bash]
----
ELASTIC_APM_DISABLE_INSTRUMENTATIONS=graphql,express-graphql
----

For an always up-to-date list of modules for which instrumentation can be disabled,
see the https://github.com/elastic/apm-agent-nodejs/tree/master/lib/instrumentation/modules[lib/instrumentation/modules] folder in the agent repository.
Note that not all modules represented in this directory will generate spans,
and adding those to this array has no effect.

To configure if incoming http requests should be instrumented,
see <<instrument-incoming-http-requests, `instrumentIncomingHTTPRequests`>>.

[[container-id]]
==== `containerId`

* *Type:* String
* *Env:* `ELASTIC_APM_CONTAINER_ID`

Specify the docker container id to associate with all reported events.
If absent,
it will be parsed out of the `/proc/self/cgroup` file.

[[kubernetes-node-name]]
==== `kubernetesNodeName`

* *Type:* String
* *Env:* `KUBERNETES_NODE_NAME`

Specify the kubernetes node name to associate with all reported events.

[[kubernetes-namespace]]
==== `kubernetesNamespace`

* *Type:* String
* *Env:* `KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE`

Specify the kubernetes namespace to associate with all reported events.

[[kubernetes-pod-name]]
==== `kubernetesPodName`

* *Type:* String
* *Env:* `KUBERNETES_POD_NAME`

Specify the kubernetes pod name to associate with all reported events.
If absent,
and if `kubernetesPodUID` is parsed out of the `/proc/self/cgroup` file,
this will default to the local hostname.

[[kubernetes-pod-uid]]
==== `kubernetesPodUID`

* *Type:* String
* *Env:* `KUBERNETES_POD_UID`

Specify the kubernetes pod uid to associate with all reported events.
If absent,
it will be parsed out of the `/proc/self/cgroup` file.

[[metrics-interval]]
==== `metricsInterval`

* *Type:* String
* *Default:* `30s`
* *Env:* `ELASTIC_APM_METRICS_INTERVAL`

Specify the interval for reporting metrics to APM Server.
The interval should be in seconds,
or should include a time suffix.

To disable metrics reporting,
set the interval to `0`.

[[metrics-limit]]
==== `metricsLimit`

* *Type:* Number
* *Default:* `1000`
* *Env:* `ELASTIC_APM_METRICS_LIMIT`

Specify the maximum number of metrics to track at any given time.
When a new metric is inserted which would exceed the limit,
the oldest metric will be dropped to give it space.

[[global-labels]]
==== `globalLabels`

* *Type:* Object
* *Env:* `ELASTIC_APM_GLOBAL_LABELS`

Supply a key/value pair object of labels to apply to any data recorded by the agent.

Example:
[source,bash]
----
ELASTIC_APM_GLOBAL_LABELS="subspace=sap-hana,rack=number6"
----

[[config-file]]
==== `configFile`

* *Type:* String
* *Default:* `elastic-apm-node.js`
* *Env:* `ELASTIC_APM_CONFIG_FILE`

The Node.js agent will look for a file named `elastic-apm-node.js` in the current working directory.
You can specify a custom path using this config option (this path must include the filename), e.g:

[source,bash]
----
ELASTIC_APM_CONFIG_FILE=/path/to/my-elastic-apm-node.js
----

NOTE: The inline version of this config option,
that is passed to the <<apm-start,`start`>> function,
will be ignored if a config file was already loaded when this module was required (based on either the default value or because of the `ELASTIC_APM_CONFIG_FILE` environment variable).

The configuration file is expected to export an object,
following the same conventions as the `options` object,
given as the first argument to the <<apm-start,`start`>> function, e.g.:

[source,js]
----
module.exports = {
  // Override service name from package.json
  // Allowed characters: a-z, A-Z, 0-9, -, _, and space
  serviceName: '',

  // Use if APM Server requires a token
  secretToken: '',

  // Set custom APM Server URL (default: http://localhost:8200)
  serverUrl: ''
}
----

[[breakdown-metrics]]
==== `breakdownMetrics`

* *Type:* Boolean
* *Default:* `true`
* *Env:* `ELASTIC_APM_BREAKDOWN_METRICS`

Used to disable reporting of breakdown metrics which records self time spent in each unique type of span.

[[cloud-provider]]
==== `cloudProvider`
* *Type:* String
* *Default:* `auto`
* *Env:* `ELASTIC_APM_CLOUD_PROVIDER`

During startup the Node.js agent queries the local environment to determine whether the application is running in a cloud environment, and provides the agent with details about that environment.  These details are called metadata, and will be sent to APM Server with other instrumented data. The `cloudProvider` configuration value allows you to control this behavior.

- `auto`: Automatically determine which cloud provider the agent is running on.
- `gcp`: Only query for Google Cloud Platform information.
- `aws`: Only query for Amazon Web Service information.
- `azure`: Only query for Azure information.
- `none`: Do not query for any cloud provider information.

If the value is not one of the five listed above, the agent will use the value of `auto`.

[[ignore-message-queues]]
==== `ignoreMessageQueues`
* *Type:* Array
* *Default:* `[]`
* *Env:* `ELASTIC_IGNORE_MESSAGE_QUEUES`
* <<dynamic-configuration, image:./images/dynamic-config.svg[] >> *Central config name:* `ignore_message_queues`

Array or comma-separated string of wildcard patterns that tell the agent to
ignore certain queues/topics when instrumenting messaging systems.

When an instrumented messaging system sends or receives a message, the agent
will test the queue/topic name against each wildcard in this list. If
the name matches, the agent will skip instrumenting the operation.

The `ignoreMessageQueues` property supports simple wildcard (`*`) patterns, and
may not include commas.  Wildcard matches are case-insensitive by default. You
may make wildcard searches case-sensitive by using the `(?-i)` prefix.

Example usage:

[source,js]
----
require('elastic-apm-node').start({
  ignoreMessageQueues: [
    'overnight_jobs',
    'events_*',
    '(?-i)caseSensitiveSearch'
  ]
})
----
