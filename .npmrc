# Workaround unresolvable peerDependencies between graphql, @apollo-server,
# and apollo-server-express. npm v7 (included with node v15) makes these
# peerDependencies issues an install error. Until the community catches up
# and resolves peerDependencies issues or apm-agent-nodejs.git's tests are
# setup to not have competing deps in "devDependencies", we revert to the
# pre-v7 behavior.
