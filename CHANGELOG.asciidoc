=== Node.js Agent version 3.x

[[release-notes-3.14.0]]
==== 3.14.0 - 2021/04/19

[float]
===== Features

* Add `apm.addMetadataFilter(fn)` for filtering the
  https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/apm/server/current/metadata-api.html[metadata object]
  sent to APM server.

* The handling of sending events (transactions, spans, errors) to APM server
  has improved in a few ways. During temporary spikes in load and/or an APM
  server that is unresponsive, the agent will buffer a number of events and
  *drop* them above a certain limit (configurable via <<max-queue-size>>).
  This helps ensure the agent does not overly consume memory and CPU. As well,
  the agent will now https://github.com/elastic/apm/blob/master/specs/agents/transport.md#transport-errors[backoff]
  when the APM server errors. Finally, improved error handling means it will
  terminate failing requests to the APM server more quickly.
+
Note: v1 of this agent (EOL'd 2 years ago), included a `maxQueueSize` config
variable with a different meaning. If you have a lingering usage of that
setting (also possibly as the `ELASTIC_APM_MAX_QUEUE_SIZE` environment
variable), then it should be removed.

* Adds support for Amazon SQS queues via `aws-sdk` instrumentation that
  partially implements the https://github.com/elastic/apm/blob/master/specs/agents/tracing-instrumentation-messaging.md[APM messaging spec],
  and adds `queue.latency.min.ms`, `queue.latency.max.ms`, and `queue.latency.avg.ms`
  metrics for SQS queues.

[float]
===== Bug fixes

* Fixed bug where the URL property for outgoing HTTP request spans was set
  with the server's IP address rather than its hostname. The Agent now sets
  this property with the actual URL requested by Node.js.

* Fixed bug where external services were not listed under Dependencies on the
  APM Service Overview page due to the trace-context propagated `sample_rate`
  value not being set on either transactions or spans.

[[release-notes-3.13.0]]
==== 3.13.0 - 2021/04/06

[float]
===== Features

* The APM agent's own internal logging now uses structured JSON logging using
  the https://getpino.io/#/docs/api?id=logger[pino API], and formatted in
  {ecs-logging-ref}/intro.html[ecs-logging] format. The log records on stdout
  are now single-line JSON objects. For example:
+
[source,bash]
----
# Before
APM Server transport error (ECONNREFUSED): connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:8200

# After
{"log.level":"error","@timestamp":"2021-03-19T00:21:17.571Z","log":{"logger":"elastic-apm-node"},
"ecs":{"version":"1.6.0"},"message":"APM Server transport error (ECONNREFUSED): connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:8200"}
----
+
Pretty formatting (and filtering) on the console may be done via the
https://github.com/trentm/go-ecslog[`ecslog`] tool.
+
A custom <<logger>> is still supported as before. However, a non-pino custom
logger will only receive the "message" field, and not structured log fields
as they are added over time.

* Add support for setting the `ELASTIC_APM_LOGGER=false` environment variable
  to disable/ignore a given custom <<logger>>. This is to support easier
  <<debug-mode>> for troubleshooting.

[float]
===== Bug fixes

* Lock package dependency "elastic-apm-http-client@9.6.0" to avoid using
  v9.7.0 for now, because it is breaking tests. A coming release will get back
  on the latest of this dependency. {issues}2032[#2032]

* Remove the "ancestors" field from a log.trace message on startup. Its info
  is a duplicate of info in the "startTrace" field in the same log record.
  {pull}2005[#2005]

* Remove the accidental `nodejs.eventloop.delay.ns` metric that was always
  reporting a zero value. The existing `nodejs.eventloop.delay.avg.ms` is
  the intended metric. {pull}1993[#1993]


[[release-notes-3.12.1]]
==== 3.12.1 - 2021/02/25

[float]
===== Bug fixes

* fix: Update https://github.com/elastic/apm-nodejs-http-client/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v951[apm-server client]
  to fix a {issues}1749[possible crash] when polling for central config.


[[release-notes-3.12.0]]
==== 3.12.0 - 2021/02/21

[float]
===== Features

* feat: Set span outcome to success or failure depending on whether an error
  was captured during when the span was active. {issues}1814[#1814]

* feat: Adds public `setOutcome` method to span and transaction APIs, and
  adds a top level `setTransactionOutcome` and `setSpanOutcome` to set
  outcome values for the current active transaction or active span.
* Limit the `transactionSampleRate` value to 4 decimal places of precision
  according to the shared https://github.com/elastic/apm/blob/master/specs/agents/tracing-sampling.md#transaction_sample_rate-configuration[APM spec]. This ensures that propagated sampling rate
  in the `tracestate` header is short and consistent. {pull}1979[#1979]

[float]
===== Bug fixes

* fix: It was possible for fetching central config to result in the
  `cloudProvider` config value being reset to its default. {issues}1976[#1976]

* fix: fixes bug where tedious could crash the agent on bulk inserts {pull}1935[#1935] +
  Reported https://discuss.elastic.co/t/apm-agent-crashes-nodejs-after-reporting-exception-in-tedious-instrumentation-code/259851[via the forum].
  The error symptom was: `Cannot read property 'statement' of undefined`

[[release-notes-3.11.0]]
==== 3.11.0 - 2021/02/08

[float]
===== Features

* feat: add `apm.getServiceName()` {pull}1949[#1949] +
  This will be used by https://github.com/elastic/ecs-logging-js[ecs-logging packages]
  to integrate with APM.

* feat: support numeric and boolean labels {pull}1909[#1909] +
  Add an optional `stringify` option to `apm.setLabel(name, version, stringify = true)`
  and `apm.addLabels(labels, stringify = true)`, which can be set `false` to
  allow numeric and boolean labels. Stringify defaults to true for backwards
  compatibility -- stringification will be removed in a future major version.

* feat: added support for cloud metadata fetching {pull}1937[#1937] +
  Agent now collects information about its cloud environment and includes this
  data in the APM Server's metadata payload. See
  https://github.com/elastic/apm/blob/3acd10afa0a9d3510e819229dfce0764133083d3/specs/agents/metadata.md#cloud-provider-metadata[the spec]
  for more information.

[[release-notes-3.10.0]]
==== 3.10.0 - 2021/01/11

[float]
===== Features

* feat: Improve handling of raw body parsing
  The agent will now report raw/`Buffer` encoded post bodies as '<Buffer>'.

* feat: Add support for api keys {pull}1818[#1818] +
  This allows the usage of API keys for authentication to the APM server

* feat: Add automatic instrumentation of the https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-js[@elastic/elasticsearch] package {pull}1877[#1870]
+
The instrumentation of the legacy "elasticsearch" package has also changed
slightly to commonalize:
+
** "span.context.destination" is set on all Elasticsearch spans, not just a
   subset of query-like API endpoints.
** For query-like API endpoints (e.g. `/_search`), the capturing of query details
   on "span.context.db.statement" has changed (a) to include *both* the
   query params and the request body if both exist (separated by `\n\n`) and
   (b) to *URL encode* the query params, rather than JSON encoding.

* feat: Add `captureAttributes` boolean option to `apm.captureError()` to
  allow *disabling* the automatic capture of Error object properties. This
  is useful for cases where those properties should not be sent to the APM
  Server, e.g. for performance (large string fields) or security (PII data).
  {pull}1912[#1912]

* feat: Add `log_level` central config support. {pull}1908[#1908] +
  Spec: https://github.com/elastic/apm/blob/master/specs/agents/logging.md

* feat: implemented sanitize_feature_names specification +
  Allows users to configure a list of wildcard patterns to _remove_ items
  from the agent's HTTP header and `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` payloads.
  ** https://github.com/elastic/apm/blob/master/specs/agents/sanitization.md[spec]
  ** https://github.com/elastic/apm-agent-nodejs/blob/master/docs/configuration.asciidoc#sanitize-field-names[docs]

[float]
===== Bug fixes

* fix: Fix parsing of comma-separated strings for relevant config vars to allow
  whitespace around the commas. E.g.:
+
----
export ELASTIC_APM_TRANSACTION_IGNORE_URLS='/ping, /metrics*'
----
+
Config vars affected are: `disableInstrumentations`, `transactionIgnoreUrls`
`addPatch`, and `globalLabels`.
* fix: Correct the environment variable for setting `transactionIgnoreUrl`
  (added in v3.9.0) from `ELASTIC_TRANSACTION_IGNORE_URLS` to
  `ELASTIC_APM_TRANSACTION_IGNORE_URLS`.


[[release-notes-3.9.0]]
==== 3.9.0 - 2020/11/30

[float]
===== Features

* feat: support fastify 3 {pull}1891[#1891] +
  Adds .default and .fastify module.exports to instrumented fastify function
  for 3.x line, and prefers req.routerMethod and req.routerPath for
  transaction name
* feat: Set "destination" context on spans for "mongodb". {pull}1893[#1893] +
  This allows Kibana APM Service Maps to show a "mongodb" node for services using
  the https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongodb[mongodb] package (which includes
  mongoose and mongojs).
* feat: transactionIgnoreUrl wildcard matching {pull}1870[#1870] +
  Allows users to ignore URLs using simple wildcard matching patterns that behave
  the same across language agents. See https://github.com/elastic/apm/issues/144

[float]
===== Bug fixes

* fix: treat set-cookie in response headers as sensitive data {pull}1886[#1886]
* fix: Synchronous spans would never have `span.sync == true`. {pull}1879[#1879]

* feat: implements tracestate {pull}1828[#1828] +
  Expands support for the W3C Trace Context specification by adding a tracestate
  header implementation, and uses this new header to track the Elastic
  transaction sample rate across a trace's service boundaries.
* feat: add span and transaction outcome {pull}1824[#1824] +
  This adds an "outcome" field to HTTP(S)
  https://github.com/elastic/apm/blob/master/specs/agents/tracing-transactions.md#transaction-outcome[transactions]
  and https://github.com/elastic/apm/blob/master/specs/agents/tracing-spans.md#span-outcome[spans].
