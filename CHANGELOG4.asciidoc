===== Breaking changes

* Set the new minimum supported Node.js to version 14.
  Users of earlier Node.js versions can use elastic-apm-node v3.x, which
  supports back to Node.js v8.6.

* Ignore a `timer` option passed to `startTransaction()` and `startSpan()` APIs.
  This option was never documented. It would be surprising if any user is
  impacted by this.
