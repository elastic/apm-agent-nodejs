# @elastic/elasticsearch
# - Version 7.7.0 included a change that broke usage with Node.js < 10.
#   Fixed in 7.7.1: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/javascript-api/current/changelog-client.html#_7_7_1
#   Note: When this repo drops Node.js v8 support, `versions` can be simplified.
# - Version 7.12.0 dropped support for node v8.
# - Version 8's min node is v12. We only support the latest canary release (at
#   time of writing). The published '8.0.0-alpha.2' is *not* supported.
