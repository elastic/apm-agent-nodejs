# Testing 'got' was initially added to test an issue in its usage of

# Supported got versions: '>=4 <12'. As of v11.8.6, this range includes 103

#   Note: When this repo drops Node.js v8 support, `versions` can be simplified.
# - Version 7.12.0 dropped support for node v8.
# - Version 8.0.0 dropped node v10 support.
# - Version 8.2.0 dropped node v12 support.
#   - Skip "8.2.0" because https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-js/pull/1688
#   - The ES client team uses "8.2.0-patch.N" for patch releases *after*
#     "8.2.0" because they are stuck with stack version numbers. However,
#     semver (and TAV) consider "-patch.N" to be a *prereleases*. This
