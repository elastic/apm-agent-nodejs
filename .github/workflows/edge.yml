# The "Edge Test" is a run of the agent test suite with pre-release builds
# of node.js, if available and useful. "Pre-release" builds are release
# candidate (RC) and "nightly" node.js builds.

  # The node.js project produces "nightly" builds of the tip of *some*
  # development branches. They get uploaded to:
  # https://nodejs.org/download/nightly/
  #
  # My observation is that nightly builds are only made for the next major
  # version *up to the point there is a release of that version*.  For example,
  # at time of writing, there is not yet a v17 release of node, and
  # "v17.0.0-nightly*" builds are being created. Once a v17.0.0 release has been
  # made, these will stop and there will be no value in testing v17 nightlies.
